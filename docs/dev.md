# Development

- [ ] Support block statements in if-else: change the definition in AST
- [ ] Unbound if and else, they should be able to use separately
- [ ] Adjust the doc for the use of parenthesis. Do we really need to get rid of them?



## Notes

For each test program, please add a comment at the top `# valid` or `# invalid` to indicate if it is still a desired test for our current implementation.
